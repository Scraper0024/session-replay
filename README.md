## What Is Session Replay?

![Session Replay](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/session-replay/046b4678108033022333c93d09daf25a.gif)

Session Replay is a video-like playback of user sessions, constructed using smart DOM snapshot technology rather than traditional screen recording. It captures your session at the DOM level—based on the browser's internal HTML structure—so you can accurately revisit every interaction, including page loads, refreshes, and navigations.

Unlike conventional video recordings, Scrapeless leverages intelligent DOM snapshots to capture:
- Every page load, refresh, and navigation
- User interactions such as clicks, scrolls, and inputs
- Dynamic DOM changes in real-time
- Full request/response network traffic

This innovative recording method allows you to travel back in time and see the exact context of what happened before, during, and after an issue. It eliminates guesswork and helps you reproduce, debug, and solve problems with complete clarity—just like having DevTools running during every session.

## Why Choose Scrapeless Session Replay?
During data extraction and automation testing, developers often face the "black box dilemma"—not knowing what truly happened inside the browser. Scrapeless Session Replay changes that by providing a visual session management system that requires no additional code and works directly from a user-friendly dashboard.

**Key Benefits:**

✅ Real-Time Recording – Automatically logs all network requests during script execution

✅ Frame-by-Frame Playback – Rewind browser actions with precision

✅ Team Collaboration – Share session recordings easily for group debugging

✅ Millisecond Accuracy – Inspect event-level timestamps for enhanced script tuning

✅ Secure Isolation – Session data is encrypted and protected with fine-grained access control

✅ Lightweight Format – Thanks to rrweb-powered DOM diffing, recording files are 90% smaller than video files
