We’re thrilled to announce that Session Replay is now live on [Scrapeless](https://www.scrapeless.com/en?utm_source=official&utm_medium=blog&utmcampaign=session-replay)! This groundbreaking feature unifies Live View, Session Inspector, and Session Recording into one seamless experience—offering a cutting-edge visual analysis capability for your browser automation workflows.

## What Is Session Replay?
Session Replay is a video-like playback of user sessions, constructed using smart DOM snapshot technology rather than traditional screen recording. It captures your session at the DOM level—based on the browser's internal HTML structure—so you can accurately revisit every interaction, including page loads, refreshes, and navigations.

Unlike conventional video recordings, Scrapeless leverages intelligent DOM snapshots to capture:
- Every page load, refresh, and navigation
- User interactions such as clicks, scrolls, and inputs
- Dynamic DOM changes in real-time
- Full request/response network traffic

This innovative recording method allows you to travel back in time and see the exact context of what happened before, during, and after an issue. It eliminates guesswork and helps you reproduce, debug, and solve problems with complete clarity—just like having DevTools running during every session.

## Why Choose Scrapeless Session Replay?
During data extraction and automation testing, developers often face the "black box dilemma"—not knowing what truly happened inside the browser. Scrapeless Session Replay changes that by providing a visual session management system that requires no additional code and works directly from a user-friendly dashboard.

**Key Benefits:**

✅ Real-Time Recording – Automatically logs all network requests during script execution

✅ Frame-by-Frame Playback – Rewind browser actions with precision

✅ Team Collaboration – Share session recordings easily for group debugging

✅ Millisecond Accuracy – Inspect event-level timestamps for enhanced script tuning

✅ Secure Isolation – Session data is encrypted and protected with fine-grained access control

✅ Lightweight Format – Thanks to rrweb-powered DOM diffing, recording files are 90% smaller than video files

### 📼 Historical Session Replay
1. **Precision Search**. Search sessions by Session ID or Session Name to group and locate sessions easily.
> Session ID is unique, and Session Name can be customized as needed, which is equivalent to Session grouping.
2. **Session Recording**. Automatically logs every browser action during a session and stores it as a playable recording.
3. **Video Playback**
- Enable Web Record to activate replay
- Click any session log to enter the detail view
- Watch auto-generated recordings
- Use the playback controller to:
  - Play / Pause
  - Scrub timeline
  - Adjust speed (1x, 2x, 4x, 8x)
> ⚠️ Session history is stored for 7 days. Older records are auto-deleted.
4. **Smart Status Indicators**
- ✅ Successful sessions: Green label + “Completed”. You can play the recording in session history.
- ❌ Failed sessions: Red label + “Error” status
5. **Common Session Failure Reasons**
- Browser launch failure (e.g., invalid parameters or environment issues)
- Scheduling timeout
- Session exceeded maximum allowed time and didn’t complete
